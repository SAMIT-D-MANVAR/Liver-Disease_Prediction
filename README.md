Exploring the Influence of Machine Learning in Healthcare: Innovating Liver Disease Prediction

Machine Learning, a facet of Artificial Intelligence, utilizes data to address various tasks. These problem-solving models learn from provided information, autonomously adapting to data patterns. Machine learning has become a ubiquitous term in today's technology landscape, witnessing rapid growth. Its impact is pervasive in daily life, with applications like Google Maps, Google Assistant, and Alexa, often operating seamlessly in the background. Real-world applications extend to speech recognition, disease diagnosis, and online fraud detection.

In our mini-project, we delve into a practical application of machine learningâ€”predicting liver disease. The liver, crucial for digestion and detoxification, can be affected by inherited factors or external influences such as viruses, alcohol consumption, and obesity.

The traditional diagnostic journey involves a patient reporting symptoms to a doctor, who then recommends specific tests based on the symptoms. These tests are conducted at analysis labs, and the results are taken back to the hospital for examination and disease identification, leading to a time-consuming process.

Our mini-project aims to streamline this diagnostic process by leveraging machine learning. Focusing on liver disease prediction, we seek to reduce time delays caused by unnecessary back-and-forth movements between the hospital and the pathology lab. Through the development of a machine learning algorithm, we intend to offer a more efficient and timely diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.

The implementation is done using Indian Liver Patient Dataset(ILPD) from north east of Andhra Pradesh ,India .

The different attributes such as Age,Gender,Total Bilirubin,Direct Bilrubin,Alkaline Phosphate,  Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Protiens, Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio,Selector field used to split the data into two sets (labeled by the experts).

Embarking on the Machine Learning Journey: Unveiling the Creation of our Liver Disease Prediction Model

Data Collection:

Delving into the Indian Liver Disease Dataset, we meticulously gather crucial data. The quality and quantity of our dataset lay the foundation for the predictive model's efficacy.
Data Preparation:

With the training data in hand, we transition to data preparation. Here, we meticulously organize and randomize the dataset, ensuring the order doesn't influence learning outcomes. We tackle data cleaning, addressing null values, and perform essential encoding, optimizing data for our chosen algorithms. Visualization aids in uncovering relationships and identifying data imbalances.
Algorithm Selection:

Tailoring our approach to supervised classification, we opt for logistic regression and decision tree algorithms, aligning with our model's objectives.
Training and Testing Data:

Dividing our dataset into training and testing sets, we dedicate the majority for model training while reserving a portion for evaluating performance. Further adjustments, including normalization and error correction, refine our dataset.
Classifier Comparison:

Through rigorous analysis, we discern which model yields superior accuracy, informing our decision-making process.
Performance Evaluation:

Iteratively enhancing our model's accuracy, we explore feature selection and parameter tuning, striving for optimal performance.
Web Application Development:

Bridging the gap between our model and end-users, we embark on web application development. 

Prediction Phase:
Empowering patients, we offer a user-friendly platform for checking liver disease status. By inputting their blood report values, individuals can swiftly access their results, facilitating informed healthcare decisions.
