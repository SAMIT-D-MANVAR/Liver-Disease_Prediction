# machine_learning_miniproject

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses data to solve tasks. These solvers are trained models of data that learn based on the information provided to them. ML algorithms use our data to learn and automatically solve predictive tasks. Machine learning is a buzzword for today's technology, and it is growing very rapidly day by day. We are using machine learning in our daily life even without knowing it such as Google Maps, Google assistant, Alexa, etc. Some of the trending real-world applications of Machine Learning include  speech recognition, disease diagnosis,  online fraud detection etc. In our  mini project we   are going to implement  one of the application of machine learning -prediction of liver disease.


Todayâ€™s Healthcare is very important aspect for every human ,so there is a need to provide medical service that are easily available to everyone. 
In this mini project ,the main focus is to predict whether a person is suffering from liver disease or not with help of machine learning model (approach).
Liver disease is any disturbance of liver function that causes illness. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body and should it become diseased or injured, the loss of those functions can cause significant damage to the body. Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease.
The implementation is done on Indian Liver Patient Dataset(ILPD) from north east of Andhra Pradesh ,India .The different attributes such as Age,Gender,Total Bilirubin,Direct Bilrubin,Alkaline Phosphate,  Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Protiens, Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio,Selector field used to split the data into two sets (labeled by the experts).
